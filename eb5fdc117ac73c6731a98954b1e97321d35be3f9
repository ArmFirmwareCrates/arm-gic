      "message": "Running `cargo test` now requires explicitly specifying the `--target [host target]` parameter, which ties the command to a specific architecture. This makes it difficult to write test or CI scripts that are architecture-independent.\nIn contrast, for `cargo build` we always know that the target is `aarch64-*` or `arm-*` regardless of the host architecture, so hardcoding the target is acceptable.\nIdeally, we could select whether this configuration value applies to `cargo test`, but currently, there doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to do that.",
